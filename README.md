 small project code to host wordpress site on local machine

 This Docker Compose file defines a multi-container environment using Docker Compose, which is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Let's break down the code:

```yaml
version: "3"
```

This specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format being used.

```yaml
services:
  database:
    image: mysql
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: wppassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wpdb
      MYSQL_USER: wpuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: wppassword
    volumes:
      - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
```

Defines a service named `database`. This service uses the official MySQL Docker image, sets environment variables for configuring the MySQL instance (root password, database name, user, and password), and creates a Docker volume named `mysql` to persistently store MySQL data.

```yaml
  wordpress:
    depends_on:
      - database
    image: wordpress:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: database:3306
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wpuser
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wppassword
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wpdb
    volumes:
      ["./:/var/www/html"]
```

Defines a service named `wordpress`. This service depends on the `database` service. It uses the latest WordPress Docker image, restarts always, maps port 80 from the host to port 80 in the container, and sets environment variables for configuring the WordPress instance (database host, user, password, and name). It also mounts the current directory (`./`) onto the container's `/var/www/html` directory.

```yaml
volumes:
  mysql: {}
```

Defines a Docker volume named `mysql` that is used by the `database` service to persist MySQL data.

In summary, this Docker Compose file sets up a WordPress application with a MySQL database. The two services (`database` and `wordpress`) run in separate containers, and Docker Compose manages their configuration and communication. The defined volumes ensure persistent data storage for the MySQL database. The entire setup is orchestrated using the specified version 3 of the Docker Compose file format.
